A Father’s day is a day set aside for honouring fathers in church services and in the home. It’s celebrated in the U.S. in the third Sunday of June. This idea was begun by Mrs John Bruces Dodd, who in 1909 persuaded an organization in Washington to salute fathers with special church services. The idea was officially agreed to by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge suggested national celebration of the day to form closer relations between fathers and their children, and to impress upon fathers the full measure of their duties. The red or white rose is recognized as the official Father’s Day flower.

A. to respect all the fathers

There were many beautiful buildings in ancient Rome, but the living conditions for ordinary people were bad. Most of their homes were so poorly made that they fell down or were fire hazards (=danger) with their steep, narrow wooden stairways. Most people were packed into apartment buildings that rose shakily (=unsafely) six to twelve floors above the ground. The apartments were rooms about three metres square, and each building housed about five hundred people.

These tall buildings faced each other across streets only three metres wide, so no sunlight reached the ground. Even so, apartments were costly, though cheaper places could be had outside Rome. But people wanted to be near their work and entertainment. So the streets became crowded and it was hard to move quickly. At night, the streets were filled with noise as food and supplies were brought into the city on wagons and carts.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has given much attention to his “Weight reduction”(减轻体重) programs. Just last year, for example, when he was the main speaker at the company dinner, he said he put on twenty pounds instead of losing thirty he promised he would.

The year before that, he joined a health club. He exercised every day and ate less food. At the end of three months, however, he began making excuses about why he couldn’t go there more often.

After the health club failed to work, he joined Weight Watchers but stopped going because he was the only man there. And he hated following any of the diet programs. Fitz’s latest idea is to join a walking club to “walk off” the weight.

What makes one person more intelligent than another? What makes one person a genius, like the brilliant Albert Einstein, and another person a fool? Are people born intelligent or stupid, or is intelligence the result of where and how you live? These are very old questions and the answers to them are still not clear.

We know, however, that just being born with a good mind is not enough. In some ways, the mind is like a leg or an arm muscle. It needs exercise. Mental (done with the mind) exercise is particularly important for young children. Many child psychologists (心理学家) think that parents should play with their children more often and give them problems to think about. The children are then more likely to grow up bright and intelligent. If, on the other hand, children are left alone a great deal with nothing to do, they are more likely to become dull and unintelligent.

Parents should also be careful with what they say to young children. According to some psychologists, if parents are always telling a child that he or she is a fool or an idiot, then the child is more likely to keep doing silly and foolish things. So it is probably better for parents to say very positive (helpful) things to their children, such as “That was a very clever thing you did.” or “You are such a smart child.”

1. The words “intelligent” and “brilliant” in the first paragraph probably mean _______ while “dull” in the second paragraph means ________.

A. bright and splendid; slow in thinking and understanding

B. pretty and handsome; ordinary-looking

C. great and important; common

D. hopeful and helpful; careless　

2. According to the context we can guess that a genius is ________ while an idiot is ________.

A. a normal person; a funny person

B. a strong person; a weak person

C. a highly intelligent person; a foolish or weak-minded person

D. a famous person; an ordinary person　

3. A person ________ is more likely to become a genius.

A. whose parents are clever

B. often thinking about difficult problems

C. often helped by his parents and teachers

D. born with a good brain and putting it into active use　

4. It is better for parents ________.

A. to praise and encourage their children more often

B. to be hard on their children

C. to leave their children alone with nothing to do

D. to give their children as much help as possible　

5. Which of the following is NOT true according to the article?

A. Parents play an important part in their children’s growth.

B. The less you use your mind the duller you may become.

C. Intelligence is obviously the result of where and how you live.

D. What makes a person bright or stupid is still under discussion.








In China some radio broadcasting stations use hotlines to encourage the listeners to take part in the talk shows.

That's a good idea. Yes, the fact is some people do nothing but break the whole programme.

Some people know little about the topic under the discussion. Sometimes they do not even know what the host(主持人)is talking about. So the host has to tell the caller what the show is about. Usually the caller will ask a few questions which express his hope and show his ignorance(无知). The host has to answer and explain──how silly this is! It wastes a lot of time.

It seems that some people phone the hotlines in fun. They just want to let the listeners hear them. They don't care what the topic is, whether they themselves are interested in the topic or how silly they appear to be.

It's necessary for radio broadcasting stations to improve the hotline programmes. In my opinion, if a caller doesn't know what is going on, the operator should not let the caller take part in it.

1. The sentence "...some people do nothing but break the whole programmes may tell us that_______.

A. radio broadcasting stations use hotlines in a wrong way

B. some people have unclear thoughts

C. there are problems to solve in the use of hotlines by some radio broadcasting stations

D. the use of hotlines by some radio broadcasting stations is a good idea

2. Which of the following is not true according to the passage?

A. Some people do not know what the host is talking about.

B. Some people do not know what the show is about.

C. Some people know little about the topic under the discussion.

D. The writer tells us that the host is silly.

3. The host has to answer and explain________.

A. because Of lots of questions raised by the caller

B. because of the caller's ignorance

C. for the host likes talking to the caller

D. for the host works hard

4. The passage doesn't tell us the idea________.

A. that some listeners phone the hotlines in fun

B. that some people just wont to be heard by others

C. that some people who don' t care what the topic is must have realized that they appear to be silly

D. what the hotline programmes are

People today expect to be examined when they enter a doctor's office. At least they expect their blood pressure and temperature to be measured. However, as recently as two hundred years ago, a doctor's treatment depended on talking with patients. In general, the communication between doctors and their patients was the most important part of medical methods. The modem age of medicine began with the stethoscope ,an instrmnent for listening to patients heartbeat and breathing. Before that, a doctor did not touch a patient. In fact,there was no such things as a medical examination.

The stethoscope──and all other medical instruments──-had a serious effect, on the practice of medicine. Doctors became better at finding the medical problems. More lives were saved. At the same time, doctors gave less importance to the communication between patients and doctors. Some doctors actually stopped talking to their patients. It is easy to understand why some sick people thought themselves as broken machines.

1. A stethoscope can be used to________.

A. check health conditions B. cure some illness

C. measure temperature D. treat heart disease

B. they could cure more diseases and save more lives

C. they had much more medical experience than before

D. they were too busy to have time to talk with patients

We may be very pleased with the rapid progress we have made in every field of study. But the way to test a student's knowledge and ability still remains as poor as it was, We have almost done nothing to improve our examination system.

It is well known that the examination system we are now using may be a good way of testing a student's memory, but it can tell you nothing about a student's ability. It does no good to students and teachers.

As soon as a child begins school,he enters a world of examination that will decide his future of job.

In fact a good examination system should train a student to think for himself. But it now does nothing about that. So students are encouraged to member what is taught. It does not enable them to gain more and note knowledge. The students who come out first in the examination often may not be the best in their studies.

Besides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time. There must be some simpler and better way to test a student' s ability besides knowledge. And that is what we should do at once.

1. Now little has been done to________.

A. decide a student's job B. test a student's ability

Some English words are made up of the same part and have different beginnings and different endings, such as import, report and transport. All these words, you can see, have the same root "port", which comes from the Latin word, meaning"to carry'or"to move"from one place to another. And according to the bit at the beginning- which we call the prefix(~S~) -the meaning changes: "import" means "to...... carry in” or "to bring into a country”; export , "ex" means "out of" , so this word means "to carry out of a country"; "re" means "back”, so the word "report” means "to tell somebody to bring back information to somebody"; "transport", "trans" means "across" and it means " to carry across one place to another".

Let's look at the following words: supporter, reporter, importer and exporter. You can see that in this case these words are nouns which are made up of the verbs plus a suffix(后辍) ,thus meaning a person who completes the verb. So supporter means somebody who supports. A reporter is somebody who reports. Importer is somebody who imports and exporter is somebody who exports, and so on.

To lift something from the floor correctly, first bend your knees and squat down. Keep your back and hips(臀部) and waist (腰部) in a line. If you bend over, the muscles ( ~ I$1 ) in your lower back can become hurt easily. If you keep your back and hips straight, the muscles are stronger, because they have much more support. The other muscles can then help the lower back muscles.

As you squat down, try to get close to the object as possible. For example, if you are going to pick up a heavy box, squat down directly in front of it.

Maybe you will have to spread your knees and legs. Put one knee on each side of the box. Remember at all times to keep your back straight.

Put your hands under the object that is in front of you, between your knees.

To lift the object, you should stand up slowly. Use your muscles in order to stand up. In other words, lift with your legs, not with your back.

In 1977, a dead author of detective stories saved the life of a 19-month-old baby in a most unusual way. The author was Agatha Christie, one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world.

In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar, near Saudi Arabia. Doctors were unable to find out the cause of her illness with confidence, so she was sent to Hammersmith Hospital in London. She was then only semi-conscious and on the "Dangerously Ill" list. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were confused by the very unusual symptoms (症状). While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to speak to them.

"Excuse me," said Nurse Marsha Maitlan, "but I think the baby is suffering from thallium (铊) poisoning."

"What makes you think that?" Dr. Brown asked. "Thallium poisoning is extremely rare."

"A few days ago, I was reading a novel called A Pale Horse by Agatha Christie," Nurse Maitlan explained. "In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are described. They're exactly the same as the baby's."

"You're very thoughtful and you may be right," another doctor said. "We'll carry out some tests and find out whether it's thallium or not."

Tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium, a rare metallic substance used in making special glass. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Later it was reported that the poison might have come from an insecticide (杀虫剂) used in Qatar.

Mary and Peter were having a picnic with some friends near a river when Mary notice an object overhead. "Look!" she shouted to her friends. "That's a spaceship up there and it's going to land here."

Frightened by the strange silver-colored spaceship, most of the young people got in their cars and drove away quickly. Peter was fond of Mary and always stayed close to her. They, more curious than frightened, watched the spaceship land and saw a door open. When nobody came out, they went to the spaceship and entered inside.

It began as a game: high school and college students studying computer technology figured out (领会到，想象出来) they could use personal computers to break into (闯入) telephone company computers and make free, long-distance telephone calls. These young computer wizards (奇才) soon gained the nickname "hackers (黑客)".

Police put the collar on (拘留，逮捕) a few hackers, but many went on to even more complex hacking. One hacker was arrested for making illegal telephone calls and later used a jailhouse (监狱) phone to alter (变更) a police officer's credit records (信用记录) to get back at (报复) the officer for arresting him. The hacker also used a computer to alter his college records to give himself better grades.

As hackers gained experience, they began invading (侵入) computers at banks, airlines and other businesses. In one scheme (计划，方案), a hacker instructed an airline's computer to give him free airplane tickets.

The U.S. government is worried hackers may break into its sophisticated (复杂的，尖端的) networks of defense computers. The government's classified (分类的) secrets are vulnerable (脆弱的) because thousands of government computers are connected by telephone lines that hackers can tap into (敲入，进入).

In November 1988, a college student tapped into a non-classified U.S. Defense Department computer network called Arpanet. The hacker injected (输入，注入) a computer program that left copies of itself throughout Arpanet. Some hackers use each "viruses (病毒)" to destroy all the data in a computer. But in this case, government officials shut down the network before the program reached every computer in the system. Shutting down the system angered many researchers who were using the computers. The hacker turned himself in (自首) to police and told them how to get his program out of the computer system. He was charged with a crime.

The incident put the spotlight on (引起注意) computer hacking in the United States. Many companies have hired experts to protect their computers from hackers, and many computer experts now advise companies on how to protect their computers.

The U.S. government believes foreign governments have hired hackers to try to break into top-secret (绝密的) defense computers. It fears a hacker could inject a virus into military computers that would erase all the data during a war.

Experts disagree over whether a computer network can ever be safe from hacking. But in the future, some of the most brilliant (杰出的，卓越的) minds in the U.S. will be working to frustrate (挫败) the efforts of computer hackers and spies.

Choose the correct answer.

1. The main idea of the article is _____.

A. computer hackers only want to make free long-distance phone calls

B. the government wants to hire computer hackers to spy on the Russians

C. computer hackers are a threat to private companies and government secrets

2. A computer "virus" is like a human virus because it _____.

A. makes a computer cough and throw up

B. spreads from one computer to other computers

C. can erase a person's doctor bills

D. requires regular visits to a doctor

3. A hacker can be dangerous because _____.

A. he knows how to make free long-distance telephone calls

B. vital information is stored in computers, and a hacker knows how to change or erase the information

C. once in jail, he can use a telephone to operate his computer

D. a hacker who steals a free airplane ticket might deprive a doctor of that seat on the airplane

4. U.S. government computers are vulnerable to a hacker because _____.

A. the government always pays its telephone bills on time

B. the Russians know what's in the U.S. computers

C. viruses attack only government computers

D. many government computers are connected by telephone lines

5. In the future _____.

A. Some of the most brilliant minds in America will be working to try to stop computer hackers and spies

Animal experimentation(实验) is the backbone(支柱，基础) of American research and treatment of disease. Each year, 17 million to 22 million animals are sacrificed in the name of(以......的名义) science. While 90 percent of them are rats and mice, 180,000 dogs, 50,000 cats, 61,000 monkeys and 554,000 rabbits are done away with in laboratories operated by industry and government.

But the public has raised an outcry(导致抗议) over these deaths. Spurred(驱策，刺激) vivid(生动的) reports of cruelty(残忍), the animal rights movement(维护动物权利运动) is made up of (由...组成)7,000 organizations with 10 million members. They've documented(用文件或证书等证明) cases in which monkeys were isolated(隔离) in steel tanks(箱、柜) for 45 days and dogs were bombarded(轰击、辐射) with radiation(放射线) or chemicals until they bled from the mouth.

Scientists say such incidents(事件) are rare. Laws have been passed to govern(管理) testing. Many research centers now have committees(委员会) to review(审查) all proposed animal experiments, and computers can be used in place of（代替）animals in many experiments. But scientists say they can't do without(不用，放弃) animals to test new drugs and treatments on animals to make sure they're safe for humans. Animal experiments produced vaccines(疫苗) or treatments for diseases such as diabetes(糖尿病), and techniques used in open heart surgery(心脏外科手术). They're important to efforts to find a treatment for AIDS.

Animal rights activists have shown they will go to almost any length(奉陪到底). One New York researcher received more than 10,000 protest(抗议) letters following publicity(公开) of her experiments in which she gave drugs to monkeys. The researcher was studying drug addiction(依赖，成瘾). A protester was arrested in Connecticut for placing a pipe bomb（铁管土炸药）outside a company that used animals in tests. After fires and break-ins(闯入，破门而入), many labs have bought electronic locks and alarms for protection. Other targets(目标，对象) of the animal rights movement are the fur industry, farms, and school biology(生物学) classes in which children dissect(解剖) frogs.

The movement has scored some successes(获得某些成功). A dozen states no longer allow pounds(兽栏) ── places that accept dogs and cats that have no homes ── to sell animals to scientists. Scientists claim the cost of their work will rise as a result.

The battle between scientists and activists raises a basic question: Can modern society be both humane(仁慈的) in its treatment of living things(生物) and advanced(先进的，高级的) in its treatment of disease? It seems certain there will be new restrictions(限制，约束) placed on the use of animals in scientific experiments.

The temperature of the sun is over 5000 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface, but it rises to perhaps more than 16 million degrees at the center．The sun is so much hotter than the earth that matter can exist only as a gas, except at the core．In the core of the sun, the pressures are so great against the gases that, despite the high temperature, there may be a small solid core．However, no one really knows, since the center of the sun can never be directly observed．

Solar astronomers do know that the sun is divided into five layers or zones．Starting at the outside and going down into the sun, the zones are the corona, chromosphere, photosphere, convection zone and finally the core．The first three zones are regarded as the sun’s atmosphere．But since the sun has no solid surface, it is hard to tell where the atmosphere ends and the main body of the sun begins．

The sun’s outermost layer begins about 10000 miles above the visible(可见的) surface and goes outward for millions of miles．This is the only part of the sun that can be seen during an eclipse (食) such as the one in February 1979．At any other time, the corona can be seen only when special instruments are used on cameras and telescopes to shut out the glare of the sun’s rays．

The corona is a brilliant, pearly white, filmy light, about as bright as the full moon．Its beautiful rays are a sensational sight during an eclipse．The corona’s rays flash out in a brilliant fan that has wispy spikelike (一束束穗状) rays near the sun’s north and south poles．The corona is thickest at the sun’s equator．

The corona rays are made up of gases streaming outward at tremendous speeds and reaching a temperature of more than 2 million degrees Fahrenheit．The rays of gas thin out as they reach the space around the planets．By the time the sun’s corona rays reach the Earth, they are weak and invisible．

1．Matter on the sun can exist only in the form of gas because of the sun’s ______．

A．size B．age C．location D．temperature

2．With what topic is the second paragraph mainly concerned?

A．How the Sun evolved．

B．The structure of the Sun．

C．Why scientists study the Sun．

D．The distance of the Sun from the planets

3．All of the following are parts of the sun’s atmosphere EXCEPT the ______．

A．corona B．chromosphere C．photosphere D．core

4．According to the passage, as the corona rays reach the planets, they become ______．

A．hotter B．clearer C．thinner D．stronger

5．The paragraphs following the passage most likely discuss which of the following?

A．The remaining layers of the sun．

B．The evolution of the sun to its present form．

C．The eclipse of February 1979．

Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago．

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly．Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses．These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times．So they are called “diseases of civilization（文明）”．Many cancers（癌） and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes（中风） are examples of such diseases．

Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol（酒精）or tabacco, probably none．Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today．

Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals．They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits．They did not use milk and other dairy products（乳制品）, and they made very little use of grains．But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods．We eat six times more salt than stone-age people．We eat more sugar．We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein（蛋白质）and much less vitamin（维生素）C．

People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods．

1．The people in industrial nations would be much healthier if they ate ______．

A．more foods as humans living 10,000 years ago did

B．as humans living 10,000 years ago ate

C．more kinds of food eaten by people living over 10,000 years ago

After all, I should have been playing in the park down Fifth Street and not in the path between buildings.

There is a definite possibility that the climate of the world may be changing. Some scientists imagine that this could even mean the beginning of another ice age. The effects of such a change in climate on the human population of the world would be startling（惊人的）.

Homing pigeons are placed in a training program from about the time they are twenty-eight days of age．They are taught to enter the loft through a trap and to exercise above and around the loft and gradually they are taken away for short distance in wicker baskets and released．They are then expected to find their way home in the shortest possible time．

In their training flights or in actual races, the birds are taken to prearranged distant points and released to find their way back to their own lofts．Once the birds are liberated, their owners, who are standing by at the home lofts, anxiously watch the sky for the return of their entries．Since time is of the essence (本质) the speed with which the birds can be induced to enter the loft trap may make the difference between gaining a win or a second place．

The head of a homing pigeon is comparatively small, but its brain is one quarter larger than that of the ordinary pigeon．The homing pigeon is very intelligent and will persevere to the point of stubbornness (顽强) ；some have been known to fly a hundred miles off course to avoid a storm．

Some homing pigeon experts claim that this bird is gifted with a form of built-in radar that helps it find its own loft after hours of flight, for hidden under the headfeathers are two very sensitive ears, while the sharp prominent (突出的) eyes can see great distances in daytime．

Why do homing pigeons fly home? They are not unique in this inherent skill； it is found in most migratory birds, in bees, ants, toads and even turtles, which have been known to travel hundreds of miles to return to their homes．But in the animal world, the homing pigeon alone can be trusted with its freedom and trained to carry out the missions that people demand．

1．What is the purpose of the passage?

A．To convince the reader to buy a homing pigeon．

B．To inform the reader about homing pigeons and their training．

C．To protect homing pigeons against the threat of extinction．

D．To encourage the owners of homing pigeons to set the birds free．

2．According to the passage, what happens to homing pigeons when they are about a month old?

A．They are kept in a trap．

B．They enter their first race．

C．They begin a training program．

D．They get their wings clipped and marked．

3．According to the passage, what is the difference between a homing pigeon and an ordinary one?

A．The span of the wings．

B．The shape of the eyes．

C．The texture of the feathers．

D．The size of the brain．

4．The underlined word “it” refers to which of the following?

A．radar B．bird C．loft D．form

5．Why does the author mention bees, ants, toads and turtles in the last paragraph?

Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left. Of 255 right-handed mothers, 83% held the baby on the left. And out of 32 left-handed women, 78% held the baby o the left. As a control, women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags; the bags were held with no side preference.

Then, dental patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment. The majority held the ball to their left side, even when it interfered with the dentist's activities. This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.

At that point something clearly contrary was observed. A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.

At that point something clearly contrary was observed. A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.

So, 115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response. The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby. 53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right. And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.

Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat. In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby, the sound of a human hear-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days. A control group of babies was not exposed to hear-beats. The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group.

1. Scientists found that _____.

A. left-handed women tend to hold their babies on the right

B. more right-handed women than left-handed women tend to hold their babies on the left

C. only right-handed women tend to hold their babies on the correct side

D. women who hold their babies on the left are nearly all right-handed

2. What was "some clearly contrary"?

A. Mothers of premature babies held their babies son the correct side.

B. Mothers of premature babies took their babies to a clinic.

C. Mothers of premature babies were seen to hold their babies differently from other mothers.

D. Mothers of premature babies showed no side preference.

3. In one experiment, 102 babies spent four days _____.

A. not exposed to heart-beats

B. in a control group

C. exposed to the sound of heart-beats

D. in a New York heart-beat group

4. The experiments proved that _____.

A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth

B. mothers hold their babies on the left at times of stress

C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left

D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side

You would like to take good photographs of real-life situations but you have few ideas for pictures. I suggest you look around you. The everyday world is full of scenes being played by an ever-changing group of actors. You probably passed a dozen picture situations without noticing on your way to work this morning.

The realistic approach to photograph has been perfected in the past by such maters as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Bill Brandt. But while you can learn a great deal from looking at the work of others, any success you can hope to achieve in this field has to come from developing an individual approach.

The main requirement for any photographer has little to do with technical matters. You must develop an awareness of the world around you and the people who live in it, and you should learn to notice when a situation may develop to a point where you will be able to take a good picture. Those who have reached this happy state will be prepared when that moment comes, and will simply raise their camera quickly and shoot. Others who are not so aware will be struggling with camera cases and lens caps.

Film manufactures must be delighted at the thought of the inexperienced photographer setting out in search of the right situation and the right moment. Many miles of costly material have passed through thousands of cameras as this endless search continues. But although a lot of this waste must be put down to inexperience, you'll find that even the professionals have to use a lot of film when they are out shooting.

Not every shot is going to be a winner. If you look at the work of even the best photographers, you'll notice dozens of pictures have had to be taken only because they lead up to the successful shot of a situation that the photographer has obviously been observing through the lens. You may find that you have taken one or two pictures after the right moment has passed as well. There is seldom more than one shot which stands out. There is just one point where it all comes together, and you often have to waste film to catch that precious moment.

1. According to the passage, one can become a better real-life photographer by _____.

A. watching other photographers at work

B. learning about famous photographers

C. just taking a great many photographs

D. developing skills and ideas for yourself

2. The writer thinks that a photographer is required to _____.

A. go out and search for unusual situations

B. be highly skilled in camera techniques

C. be able to tell when a good situation might come

D. have a camera which is easy and quick to use

3. Most likely, to catch the right moment, one must _____.

A. take pictures without too much preparation

B. take a whole series of similar pictures

C. take great care to set up the situation

D. take one picture just at the right moment

4. Which of the following is TRUE?

A. The waste of film in photography is essential to the production of good pictures.

B. Film manufacturers usually enjoy pictures by inexperienced photographers.

C. Only amateur photographers waste film in taking pictures.

D. The waste of film, which is the result of poor choice of subject, is expensive and unnecessary.

5. The passage is _____.

A. part of a book of camera instruction

B. an advertisement for film

C. a history of photography

D. an introduction to photography

The Komodo lizard is the world's largest lizard(蜥蜴). It was not discovered until this century and was named only in 1921. It was formerly found on three Indonesian islands: Komodo, Rintja and Flores. By the 1930's, in spite of government protection, the population of this great lizard had been reduced to a few hundred. It was, however, still found on the three main islands and there were still lizards of over 4 metres in length. By 1963, after a period of only fifty years since its discovery, the entire population was based on Komodo. It is now unusual to see one as long as 3 metres. The lizard's normal food consists mainly of wild goats and pigs, animals which the islanders also hunt. This, of course, means that the lizard often gets too little to eat. It will certainly die out soon its hunting and breeding(繁殖) grounds are protected more effectively.

In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes(想当然地认为)it's a matter of life and death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.

In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the attention to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise(产生) between people from cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think if keeping a business associate waiting for an hour. It would be too impolite. A person who is 5 minutes late is expected to make a short apology. If he is less than 5 minutes late, he will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.

Trees should only be pruned(修剪) when there is a good and clear reason fordoing so and, fortunately, the number of such reasons is small. Pruning involves the cutting away of overgrown and unwanted branches, and the inexperienced gardener can be encouraged by the thought that more damage results from doing it unnecessarily than from leaving the tree to grow in its own way.

First, pruning may be done to make sure that trees have a desired shape or size. The object may be to get a tree of the right height, and at the same time to help the growth of small side branches which will thicken its appearance or give it a special shape. Secondly, pruning may be done to make the tree healthier. You may cur out diseased or dead wood, or branches that are rubbing against each other and thus causing wounds. The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing the branches that are locking up the centre and so preventing the free movement of air.

One result of pruning is that an open would is left on the tree and this provides an easy entry(进入)for diseases, but it is a wound that will heal. Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die, or that there is a period when the tree is at risk. It should be the aim of every gardener to reduce the risk as far as possible. It is essential to make the area which has been pruned smooth and clean, for healing will be slowed down by roughness. You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then paint it with one of the substances available from garden shops produced especially for this purpose. Pruning is usually done in winter, for then you can see the shape of the tree clearly without the interference(干扰) from the leaves and it is, too, very unlikely that the cuts you make will bleed. If this does happen, it is, of course, impossible to paint them properly.

1. According to the article,_____.

A. damage is done to a tree if it is left to grow in its own way

B. pruning is necessary when a tree has grown into a definite shape or size

C. diseased or dead branches should be cut away if they are found to rub against each other

D. growing side branches often prevent air from moving freely

2. Which of the following usually causes a tree to grow unhealthy?

A. Giving a tree a special shape and a definite height

B. Removing small side branches and making a tree look less thick

C. Allowing too many branches to grow in the middle

D. Having a tree surrounded by many other trees

3. The writer suggests that pruning should be done in winter because _____.

A. the cut surface gets dry more quickly

B. open wounds on the tree run the less risk of getting diseased

C. a gardener can do pruning more easily

D. wounds painted with a special substance heal quickly

4. The writer's purpose when writing this passage is _____.

Minutes of the meeting held in Malupit Community School on Wednesday 14th March at 8.00p.m．

Mr. I．Pomat , a Malupit shop owner, called the meeting to find out the views of the community on local government plans to close the Malupit Community School at the end of the present school year．

Mr. Pomat acted as chairman of the meeting．

He introduced Mr. L．Karazin, the Planning Office of the Raval Education Department．Mr. Karazin pointed out that there were now only fifty-three children at Malupit Community School．This was considered to be too high a number for the forming of two classes and the employment of two teachers．Mrs. Luvako, who had taught at the school for the past twenty-two years, would be retiring from the teaching service in July．The Planning Office wished to take this opportunity to close the school, because it is expensive to run , and to move the children to two bigger schools in Raval, six miles away．

Mrs. Jarvis, the mother of an eight-year-old boy at Malupit, asked what would happen about transport o Ravel．Mr. Karazin replied that the children would travel by bus．This would be provided by the Raval Transport Department, and it would take Malupit children to and from school free of charge．

Another parent, Mr. W．Riley, expressed the fear of many parents that closing the local school would mean that the children of Malupit would not grow up with the same sense of community as in the past．They would feel lost in the much larger schools in Raval．

Mr. Karazin replied that the Raval schools were not very large, and that , in any case the children would have to go to Raval later on for education at high-school level．

The chairman voiced the view of the meeting when he said hat there was good reason to believe that there would soon be more young children living in Malupit．It would be foolish, he said, to close the school, and then to find that there were more than enough local children to form two classes and employ two teachers．

A final point was made by Mr. Colmar, a retired business man, that without Malupit Community School, there would be nowhere big enough for local clubs and organizations to hold their meetings．

Mr. Karazin promised that the would bring these points to the attention of the Education Department．

Dear Sir,

Just over six months ago, I saw an advertisement in the Morning Mail for a set of the complete works of William Shakespeare．Your company, Cosmo Books Ltd., offered this set (eight books of plays and two books of poetry)at what was claimed to be a ‘remarkable’price:fifteen pounds and fifty pence, including postage and packing．I had wanted a set of Shakespeare’s plays and poems for some time, and these books in red imitation leather, looked particularly attractive;so I sent for them．

Two weeks later, the books arrived, together with a set of the complete works of Charles Dickens which I had not ordered．So I returned the Dickens books to you , with a cheque for fifteen pounds and fifty pence for the works of Shakespeare．Two more weeks passed．Then there arrived on my door step a second set of the works of Shakespeare, the same set of novels by Dickens and a six-book set of the plays of Moliere, in French．Since I do not read French, these were of no use to me at all．However, I could not afford to post all these books back to you , so I wrote to you at the end of August of last year, instructing you to come and collect all the books that I did not want, and asking you not to send any other books until further notice．

You did not reply to that letter．Instead you sent me a bill for forty-two pounds, and a set of the plays of Schiller, in German．Since then, a new set of books has arrived every two weeks:the works of Goethe, the poems of Milton, the plays of Strindberg;I hardly know what I have．The books are still all in their boxes, in the garage, and my car has to stand in the rain outside．

I have no room for any more books, and even if I read from now on until the Last Judgement, I should not finish reading all the books that you hove sent me．

Please send no more books, send no more bills, send no more angry letters demanding payment．Just send one large lorry and take all the books away, leaving me only with the one set of the complete works of Shakespeare for which I have paid．

Yours faithfully,

Simon Walker

Exchange of Letters

Dear Mr. Harringtom,

I saw your name on a list of teachers of French who wish to spend their holidays in France this summer．I am a teacher of English in Saint-Simon, a charming little village in the Loire valley, just south of Saumur．I should very much like to spend some time in England, because it is many years since I had an opportunity to practise my English．Perhaps we could exchange houses for three weeks in late July or early August．

I have heard a lot about Cumbria and the Lake District．I have been keen to spend a holiday in Cumbria ever since I first saw pictures of the foxhunting, and read about the fine hunting dogs that you have in your part of the country．I am very interested in fox-hunting and I take my dogs out hunting in the local forest whenever I can．

I shall tell you more about Saint-Simon and the surrounding countryside when and if you express interest in my plan．I look forward to hearing from you．

Yours sincerely,

Jean-Baptiste Foucault

Dear Mr. Foucault,

I was very interested to receive your letter of 3rd March．You are right in thinking that I should like to spend some time in France．I am sure my French is as rusty as your English!

You are also right in thinking that Cumbria is famous for its foxes and its hunting dogs;but there are many other things for which Cumbria is famous．Barrow, for example, it famous for its ship-building industry; I live just across the road from the docks where ships from Ireland and elsewhere load and unload．In fact, on days when the Irish Sea is not under a blanket of fog, I can see the hills of Northern Ireland in one direction, as clearly as I can see the Cumbrian hills in the other．

In short, I am afraid Barrow might not have been what you had in mind when you thought about a holiday in Cumbria．Instead of being able to offer you the dog and the fox, I can only offer you the fog and the docks!

Yours sincerely,

Robert Harrington

Robert Spring, a 19th century forger (伪造签字者), was as good at his profession that he was able to make his living for 15 years by selling false signatures of famous Americans. Spring was born in England in 1813 and arrived in Philadelphia in 1858 to open a bookstore. At first he make some money by selling his small but genuine of early U.S. autographs (亲笔签字). Discovering his ability at copying handwriting, he began imitating signatures of George Washington and Ban Franklin and writing them on the title pages of old books. To make less the chance of detection (发觉), he sent his forgeries (伪造物) to England and Canada for sale and circulation (销售).

Forgers have a hard time selling their products. A forger can't approach a respectable buyer but must deal with people who don't have much knowledge in the field. Forgers have many ways to make their work look real. For example, they buy old books to use the aged paper of the title page, and they can treat paper and ink with chemicals.

In Spring's time, right after the Civil War, Britain was still fond of the Southern states, so Spring invented a respectable maiden lady known as Miss Fanny Jackson, the only daughter of General "Stonewall" Jackson. For several years Miss Fanny's economic problems forced her to sell a great number of letters and manuscripts belonging to her famous father. Spring had to work very hard to satisfy the demand. All this activity did not prevent Spring from dying in poverty, leaving sharp-eye experts the difficult task of separating this forgeries from the originals.

1. Why did Spring sell his autographs in England and Canada?

A. There was a greater demand there than in America.

B. There was less chance of being detected there.

C. Britain was Spring's birthplace.

2. After the Civil War, there was a great demand in Britain for ___.

3. Robert Spring spent 15 years ___.

A. running a bookstore in Philadelphia

B. corresponding with Miss Fanny Jackson

C. as a forger

D. as a respectable dealer

4. According to the passage, forgeries are usually sold to ___.

A. sharp-eyed experts

In 1909 an English newspaper offered ￡1,000 to the first man to fly across the English Channel in an aeroplane. Today, modern jets cross it in minutes. But at that time it still seemed a good distance. The race to win the money soon became a race between two men. Both were very colorful.

One is Louis Bleriot. He owed a factory in France that made motor car lamps. He was already well known as a pilot because he had crashed several times. Some people laughed at him. One man said, "He may not be the first to fly across the Channel but he will certainly be the first to die in a crash!" But Bleriot was really a good and brave pilot. He also had many good ideas about aeroplane design.

The other man was Hubert Latham. He was half French and half English. He took up flying when his doctors told him he had only a year to live. "Oh, well," he said, "If I'm going to die soon, I think I shall have a dangerous and interesting life now." Latham was the first to try the flight across the Channel. Ten kilometers from the French coast, his plane had engine trouble. It crashed into the water and began to sink under the water. A boat reached Latham just in time. He was sitting calmly on the wing and was coolly lighting a cigarette. Bleriot took off six days later. He flew into some very bad weather and very low cloud. He somehow got to the English side and landed in a farmer's field. When he did so, a customs officer rushed up to his plane. Planes have changed since then but customs officers have not. "Have you anything to declare?" the officer demanded.

1. The story took place ___.

A. in the early 20th century

B. in the 19th century

C. right after World War I

D. at a time not mentioned in the passage

2. "A good distance" here means ___.

A. a fairly long distance

B. a distance shorter than people thought

C. an easy flying distance

D. no distance at all

3. Bleriot was well known as a pilot because ___.

A. he was exceptionally brave

B. he was quite rich

C. he had many good ideas about the aeroplane design

D. he had a few accidents

4. Why did Hubert Latham want to fly across the Channel?

A. He thought he could manage it easily.

B. He wanted to compete with Louis Bleriot.

C. He knew he only had a year to live.

D. He had always been interested in flying.

5. Why did the customs officer rush to the plane?

A. To see if everything was all right with the plane.

B. To make sure that the pilot was not hurt.

C. To ask why the plane had landed in a farmer's field.

D. None of the above.

Frederic Chopin was one of the greatest composers of music for the piano. He wrote over two hundred musical compositions. They are still popular today.

Frederic Chopin was born in 1810 in Zelazowa-Wola, a village near Warsaw, Poland. His father had moved there from France. Chopin was to feel strong ties to Poland throughout his life. Many of his musical works have the spirit and rhythm (节奏) of Polish folk dances.

Chopin showed musical ability at an early age. He was giving public concerts and writing music by the time he was eight years old. The young Chopin often performed for members of the wealthy Polish nobility. He was a guest in their homes and was treated well by them.

Poland was a kingdom under Russian control. In 1831, Chopin left Poland to make a tour of other European countries. While he was away, the Poles tried to win freedom from Russia. Their rebellion failed, and the Kingdom of Poland was crushed. Chopin never returned to his homeland.

The piano fascinated Chopin. Believing that it could produce new and varied music, he challenged (对……有异议) many of the strict rules that were followed by earlier composers. Chopin created lively, moving music by using new musical patterns.

Chopin suffered from poor health. He became ill with tuberculosis (肺结核), a disease that affected his lungs. It caused his death in 1849, when he was only thirty-nine years old.

1. We can infer from the passage that ___.

A. Chopin died in a foreign country

B. the Poles fought against the Russians and succeeded in defeating them in 1831

C. Chopin followed many of the strict rules as some earlier composers

D. although Chopin loved his motherland, he had never learned anything from Polish folk dances

It was not yet eleven o'clock when a boat crossed the river with a single passenger who had obtained his transportations at that unusual hour by promising an extra fare. While the youth stood on the landing-place searching in his pockets for money, the ferryman lifted a lantern, by the aid of which, together with the newly risen moon, he took a very accurate survey (打量) of the stranger's figure. He was a young man of barely eighteen years, evidently country bred, and now, as it seemed, on his first visit to town. He was wearing a rough gray coat, which was in good shape, but which had seen many winters before this one. The garments under his coat were well constructed of leather, and fitted tightly to a pair of muscular (肌肉发达的) legs; his stockings of blue yarn (线) must have been the work of a mother or sister, and on his head was a three-cornered hat, which in its better days had perhaps sheltered the grayer head of the lad's father. In his left hand was a walking stick, and his equipment was completed by a leather bag not so abundantly stocked as to inconvenience the strong shoulders on which it hung. Brown, curly hair, well-shaped features, bright, cheerful eyes were nature's gifts, and worth all that art could have done for his adornment (装饰). The youth, whose name was Robin, paid the boatman, and then walked forward into the town with a light step, as if he had not already traveled more than thirty miles that day. As he walked, he surveyed his surroundings as eagerly as if he were entering London or Madrid, instead of the little metropolis (首府) of a New England colony (殖民地).

1. What time of year was it in this story?

A. spring

B. summer

C. fall

D. winter

2. At what time of day did Robin cross the river?

A. morning

B. midday

C. late afternoon

D. night

3. The boatman was willing to take Robin across the river because ___.

B. he saw that Robin was young and rich

C. he was going to row across the river anyway

Which is safer ── staying at home, traveling to work on public transport, or working at the office? Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low. However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home.

The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby. It is this that chemical accidents so newsworthy. Fortunately, they are extremely rare. The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984).

Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small. No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough. The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed. The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552. The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal.

Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger. Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity. The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production going during essential repairs. The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep. When the poisonous gas drifted over the town, local leaders were incapable of taking effective action. The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb. The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks. Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode. Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

1. Which of the following statements is TRUE?

A. Working at the office is safer than staying at home.

B. Travelling to work on public transport is safer than working at the office.

C. Staying at home is safer than working in the chemical industry.

D. Working in the chemical industry is safer than traveling by air.

2. From the passage we know that ammonium nitrate is a kind of _____.

A. natural gas, which can easily catch fire

B. fertilizer, which can't be stored in a great quantity

C. poisonous substance, which can't be used in overcrowded areas

D. fuel, which is stored in large tanks

3. From the discussion among some experts we may conclude that _____.

A. to avoid any accident we should not repair the facilities in chemical industry

B. the local authorities should not be concerned with the production of the chemical industry

C. all these accidents could have been avoided or controlled if effective measures had been taken

D. natural gas stored in very large tanks is always safe





Every weekday morning I take the 8:30 bus to go to my job. I know by sight several people who also fide that bus. Some of the girls work as maids. They get off at each stop in ones, twos or threes.

But at one corner something wonderful happens. Before the bus stops, a little dog races out of the nearest house. He doesn't look at two of the maids who get off. But for the third he has a joyful "Hello!". From head to tail his little body wags his happiness. Everyone on the bus watches until the maid and the dog go into the house.

One day not long ago the maid wasn't on the bus. I wondered if the dog would be waiting for her. Sure enough, he was!

He stood at the back door of the bus for a minute. I could see his joyful welcome turning into fearful worry. Where was she?

The driver closed the back door. The dog raced to the front door. It, too, shut in his face.

Everyone on the bus felt sad. Poor little pup! He looked so unhappy, standing there!

The driver couldn't stand it. He opened the door and looked down at the dog. "She didn't come today," he said, in a loud, kind voice.

A man in a front seat leaned forward. "Maybe she will come tomorrow," he called.

The dog wagged his tail as if to say "thank you." He watched the bus as we pulled away. Then he turned to trot home ── alone.

The next day everyone on the bus was happy to see the maid back again. Yes, the dog was waiting for her.

The welcome he gave her was even warmer and more delighted than usual. We all smiled at one another. How bright and good the morning suddenly seemed to us!

After we meet people it is up to us to make them our friends. Let us stop a moment and consider what really makes a friend. The major qualities like faithfulness, devotion, friendly company, flash through our minds. But it is the large number of very small particular qualities that make up one's whole character, such as cheerfulness, friendliness, and punctuality. After all, "to make a friend, be a friend" is not such a big and difficult order. There are particular favorable qualities, which attract others to us, and some elements which do have an effect on people in fundamental psychology or not.

If you are in the presence of a shy person, talking and asking casual (随意的) questions may bring him out of his shell. Think of what would be most acceptable to the other person, for you to talk, or to listen. Either way the goal is to make yourself pleasant.

Always remember to listen, but listen intelligently. To have anyone "hang on our words" is the most unnoticeably clever way in the world to please somebody. For a few extremely happy seconds we are the center of attraction, but when it is our turn to be audience, let us remember how we felt as the actor, and let's be genuinely (真正地) interested in what the other fellow is saying.

Other people will like us, if we like them. If you want friends, keep your mind and heart open to friendship. Be alive to the other person's world.

That was enough to make him important, but his father loved him especially, because he knew his son was going to be an artist.

Kevin Rogers used to be my boss. At that time he was a hard-working, up-and-coming businessman and a real slave-driver, always telling us we had to sell more and more. As soon as I could, I got a job with another company. The last time I saw Rogers was more than ten years ago. At least that's what I thought until last Thursday. But now I'm not so sure.

I was on my way back to my office in the center of town. There is a small park nearby which I sometimes walk through after lunch. It was almost empty, except for an unshaven, shabby-looking man on one of the benches. He looked about fifty years old and was wearing an old, gray overcoat. it was a cold, wintry day, and he was shivering.

"It's been a long time since I had a meal. Can you help me?" he said. There was something about his voice that sounded familiar. I gave him a few coins and he mumbled something about being grateful. As he stumbled (蹒跚) past me, I looked at his face closely. I wondered where I had seen him before. Then it hit me. Could it possibly be ...? No! Impossible, I thought. I watched him walking away. He was the same height as Rogers but looked a lot thinner than I remembered. Then, as he left the park and turned down the street, I caught sight of his face again, this time from his side. The nose was the same as Rogers' too. I almost followed him but something made me stop. I just couldn't be sure. But the resemblance (相似) was very close.

Yesterday I ran into someone who had worked for Rogers at the same time I did, and had stayed on longer. I started telling him about the man I had seen in the park. "For a moment I thought it was our old boss. The voice, the nose, and even the face were just like Rogers. But it couldn't have been. Rogers must be the director of a big company by now." I said.

My ex-colleague (先前的同事) shook his head. "I thought you knew."

"Knew? Knew what? What are you talking about?"

"Rogers was sent to prison six years ago. He's probably out by now. For all I know he's sleeping on park benches and begging money from passers-by."

Lucky is the man who has no “skeleton in his closet.” When a man has done something in his life that he is ashamed of, that he wants to hide, he is said to have a “skeleton in his closet.” Some people may have more than one skeleton.

As we have noted many times, it is hard to find out how these expressions begin. Sometimes, we get some hard facts. But more often we have to depend on guesswork. And that is true of this phrase, which came from England.

Before 1932,English law did not permit a doctor to cut open a dead human body for scientific examination, unless it was the corpse(尸体) of an executed(处决) criminal.

But when it became legal, more and more doctors demanded skeletons for a more scientific study of medicine. It was helping in the advance of modern medicine. The demand had become so strong that men began to rob tombs and sell skeletons to doctors at high prices.

We are told that a doctor would usually buy just one skeleton for scientific study. It became very important in his work. But he had to keep it hidden because most people objected to keeping such a thing. As a rule, the doctor would keep his skelton in some dark corner where it could not be seen, or hide it in a closet.

After a time, people began to suspect(怀疑) every doctor of hiding a skeleton in the closet. From this suspicion, the phrase “a skeleton in the colset” took on a broader, more general meaning. To describe anything that a man wanted to keep others from discovering. It could be proof of a criminal act, or something much less serious. Well, that is one theory.

One writer, however, believes that the phrase might have come from something that really happened. It is his guess that a hidden closet in some old English country home may have turned up a real skeleton, clear proof of some old family shame or crime. Well, one man's guess is as good as another. But this sounds like a story by the great French novelist, Balzac.

Baizac tells us of a man who suspected his wife of having a lover. The husband comes home by surprise. But she hears him and quickly hides her lover in the closet of her bedroom. He enters her room and asks her if she is hiding her lover. He says he will not open the door to the closet if she promises him there is no one there; He will believe her. She answers firmly that she is not hiding anyone in the closet.

The husband then begins to build a solid brick wall against the closet. His wife watches, knowing that her lover will never come out alive. But she will not change her the story and admit her guilt.

1.Which of the following situations is suitable for using the phrase “Skeleton in the closet”?

A. You have stolen something presious and don't want it discovered.

B. You are a doctor and have to keep a skeleton for research

C. If you have cut open a dead human body for scientific examination you should keep the skeleton secret.

D. You have done a crime or done something foolish, but you want to keep others from discovering it.

2.From the text we know that there are _____ theories about how the phrase “skeleton in the closet” came into being.

A. one 　　　　　B. two 　　　　　C. three 　　　　D. four

3.In Chinese the world “Skeleton” means ________ .

4.Which of the following is right according to the text?

A. In the 19th century, doctors realized the importance of anatomy(解剖) in the development of medicine.

B. The doctors of the ancient times liked to collect as many skeleton as possible.

D. It is legal that corpses of anybody are cut open for scientific examination in history.

Although man has known about asbestos for many hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H. W. Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers, was responsible for (对……负责)the opening of that first mine.

Mr, Jonhs was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves, which looked much like ordinary work gloves, he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imaging that he had increasing business in asbestos roofing materials. However, because it was very expensive to transport(carry)them from Italy to the United States, Mr Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein(岩脉), in the province of Quebec in Canada.

Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral, which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated, a strange thing happens ;the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibres(纤维).

Scientists do not know why the rock can be separated easily into threads(线), but they have found thousands of uses for this fireproof material, of the called the “cloth of stone”.

The news report that night was about a famine(饥荒)in Ethiopia. The pictures were of people who were so thin that they looked like beings from another planet. The camera (摄像机)focused (聚焦)on one man so that he looked directly at me, sitting in my comfortable living room. All around was the sound of death.

It was clear that the world had not noticed this until now. You could hear the sadness in the voice of the reporter. Michael Buerk. At the end of the report he was silent. Paula started crying, then rushed upstairs to check our baby, Fifi, who was sleeping peacefully.

I kept seeing the news pictures in my mind. What could I do? I was only a pop singer and by now not a very successful pop singer. All I could do was to make records which no one bought. But I would do that. I would give all the profits (利润)of the next Rats (the name of the music group he was in)record to Oxfam (an organization in Britain which helps poor people around the would). What good would that do? It would only be a little money but it was more than I could give just from my bank account. Maybe some people would buy it because the profits were for Oxfam. And I would be protesting about this disaster (灾难). But that was not enough.

1. What do we learn about the writer from the text?

Problem Page

Dear Lifeline,

I shall be getting married in August．My mother wants me to have a white wedding in church, because I am the only daughter, and she wants me to have the kind of wedding that she had．I , on the other hand, would like to have a simple wedding and a small party afterwards for my immediate family and close friends．I don’t want my parents to go to a lot of expense just for one day;I’d rather they spent the money on things that my husband and I will need, that will last us for many years．

Do you agree with me that this is a reasonable point of view? Can you think of a way in which I might persuade my parents to think as I do ?

Yours,

Money-Conscious

Dear Money-Conscious,

We agree that your point of view is reasonable; but reason isn’t everything. Your parents clearly do not mind ‘going to a lot of expense’, as you put it. They would mind more if you prevented them from doing so. There is, in fact, no reason why a white wedding in church should cost a lot of money. Such a wedding can be very simple, yet it can give you the sort of happy memories that your mother has of her own wedding day．

We suggest you meet your mother halfway. Have a simple church wedding and a simple party afterwards. If it means so much to your mother, perhaps you owe it to her to do as she wishes. We are sure that you will not regret it．

Dear lifeline,

I have known my girlfriend for six years. The other day, I asked her to marry me, certain that I knew what the answer would be. But she said she wanted to think about it．

I shall be going on holiday soon, and I hoped she would come with me; but now she says she’d rather go on holiday with a friend of hers. Am I losing her?

Yours,

Deeply Worried

Dear Deeply Worried,

Perhaps you were too certain of your girlfriend. Six years is a long time. Perhaps you have been in each other’s packets for too long. Give yourselves a holiday from each other, and then ask her again on your return. We think you will find that she will give you the answer that you want．

Until late in the 20th century, most Americans spent time with people of different generations. Now middle-aged Americans may not keep in touch with old people until they are old themselves.

That's because we group people by age. We put our three-year-olds together in day-care centers, our 13-year-olds in schools and sports activities, and our 80-year-olds in senior-citizen homes. Why?

We live away from the old for many reasons. Young people sometimes avoid the old to get rid of fears of aging and dying. It is much harder to watch someone we love dis-appear before our eyes. Sometimes it's so hard that we stay away from the people who need us the most.

Fortunately, some of us have found our way to the old. And we have discovered that they often save the young.

A reporter moved her family onto a block filled with old people. At first her chil-dren were disappointed. But the reporter baked banana bread for the neighbours and had her children deliver it and visit. Soon the children had many new friends, with whom they shared food, stories and projects. "My children have never been less lonely," the re-porter said.

The young, in turn, save the old. Once I was in a rest home (养老院) when a visitor showed up with a baby, she was immediately surrounded. People who hadn't gotten out of bed in a week suddenly were ringing for a wheelchair. Even those who had seemed asleep woke 'up to watch the child. Babies have an astonishing power to comfort and cure.

Grandparents are a special case. They give their grandchildren a feeling of security (安全) and continuity. As my husband put it, "My grandparents gave me a deep sense that things would turn out right in the end." Grandchil-dren speak of attention they don't get from worried parents. "My parents were always telling me to hurry up, and my grandparents told me to slow down," one friend said. A teacher told me she can tell which pupils have rela-tionships with grandparents: they are quieter, calmer and more trusting.

Nobody Benefits

NEW YORK—America has been experi-encing the longest economic increase in its history. Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings.

But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel.

Brown is homeless — one of the 2.3 mil-lion people in the US who end up on the street.

During the day. Brown collects alumini-um cans and sells them for five cents a piece. At night, he sleeps on the street.

"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that," said the 62-year-old former construction worker.

Brown admits he's had problems with al-cohol and has smoked cocaine. But he said he still wants a more stable (稳定的) housing ar-rangement. He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available.

However, he sees no hope of finding af-fordable housing in New York.

With the strong economy and unemploy-ment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand.

A US report shows rents in New York city rose more than 27 per cent between 1984 and 1999, from US $549 to US $700 a month.

One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up.

The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help.

But few housing companies have been built for the poor. Many small apartments in the city now rent for US $1,500 a month or more.

Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her. She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house.

Smiling, he said he also has seven grand-children whom he'd like to see more often.

"All I've got to do is clean up my act," he said.

1. What kind of life does George Brown lead?

A. Homeless and dangerous. B. Homeless and childish.

C. Homeless and miserable. D. Homeless and sleepless.

2. From George Brown's life we can find that

A. old Americans lead a hard life

B. old Americans want to live alone

C. American cities are full of poor people

D. bad habits play a role in poor people's Life

3. It can be inferred from this passage that

A. America is short of housing companies

B. the poor can't benefit from the increas-ing economy

C. poor people in America will become rich

D. housing companies will build more houses for the poor

More Taiwanese Students Study Here

TAIBEI—Increasing numbers of Taiwanese students are joining the island's "China rush", seeking education on the Chinese mainland.

According to official Chinese figures, the number of Taiwanese students admitted into college and postgraduate programmes on the mainland totalled 461 in 1996, 928 in 1997 and 839 in 1998. Although no latest official numbers were available, Netbig.com said this number had risen between 30 to 50 per cent annually in the past two years with well over 1,000 entering mainland campuses last year.

The Internet site, based in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, provides education service and information on Chinese mainland colleges and universities. "Many Taiwanese believe a Chinese education giving more knowledge about the people and culture in the mainland will increase their chances in the Chinese job market," Netbig.com vice-president Ingrid Huang said. "I believe it will give me hands-on ex-perience in the business field in the Chinese mainland and a better understanding of the Chinese mainland people," said Lydia Chang, a 19-year-old majoring in journalism at Shih Shin University. Chang plans to go on to get a master's degree in business administration in Shanghai, which she says offers the best envi-ronment for such studies.

A journalism graduate student, sumamed Lin, at the National Taiwan University said he would like to study law on the Chinese main-land since "there will be better career prospects for me now that more Taiwanese companies are going there".

Some business executives were sending their children to study in the Chinese main- land. "They hope the children could build up connections which could later become useful in their business operations," said Yang Ching-yao, professor of the Chinese mainland studies.

A Netbig.com survey showed the campus-es favoured by Taiwanese students included Beijing, Qinghua and Renmin universities in Bei-jing, and Jinan and Zhongshan universities in Guangzhou. The most popular studies were law, business and Chinese medicine.

At present, Chinese Taibei doesn't recog-nize diplomas earned in the Chinese mainland nor help with any inquiries about studying there. But recognizing the trend, education au-thorities are giving a final form to a policy accepting certificates (iiE45) from selected uni-versities.

Parents have to do much less for their children today than they used to do, and home has become much less of a workshop. Clothes can be bought ready made, washing can go to the laundry, food can be bought cooked, canned or preserved, bread is baked and delivered by the baker, milk arrives on the doorstep, meals can be had at the restaurant, the workers' canteen (食堂), and the school dining-room.

It is unusual now for father to pursue (从事) his trade or other employment at home, and his children rarely, if ever, see him at his place of work. Boys are therefore seldom trained to follow their father's occupation, and in many towns they have a fairly wide choice of employment and so do girls. The young wage-earner often earns good money, and soon acquires a feeling of economic indepen-dence. In textile (纺织的) areas it has long been customary for mothers to go out to work, but this practice has become so widespread that the working mother is now a not unusual factor in a child's home life, the number of married women in employment having more than doubled in the last twenty-five years. With. mother earning and his older children drawing substantial wages, father is seldom the dominant (支配的) figure that he still was at the beginning of the century. When mother works, eco-nomic advantages increase, but children lose something of great value if mother's employment prevents her from being home to greet them when they return from school.

1. The writer compares home to a workshop because _____.

A. fathers often pursue employment at home

B. parents have to make food and necessity themselves for their daily-life

C. many families produce goods at home for sale

D. both fathers and mothers in most families are workers

2. The writer says that home has become much less of a workshop. He means _____.

A. in the past, home was more like a workshop

B. home is much more of a workshop now

C. home workshops are becoming fewer and fewer

D. home was less like a workshop in the past

3. The chief reason that boys are seldom trained to follow their father's occupation is _____.

A. that children nowadays rarely see their fathers at their place of work

B. that fathers do not like to pursue employment at home any more

C. that there is a wide choice of employment for children

D. that children also like to have jobs outside

4. What makes father no longer be the only dominant person in a family?

A. With their earning, mother and children do not need to depend on father for their life.

B. There are many choices of employment for mothers and children.

C. Father does much less for his children today than he used to-

I never realized that bureaucratism (管僚主义) hated criticism so much until I myself was taught a good lesson by some bureaucrats.

One sunny morning, I went to a high－level organization to report on some business. Once in the office, I found the man in charge busy and about to leave. “Wait a minute, please. You are the comrade I was told I must see.” I walked closer to the chief.

“Sorry, I’m busy now,” the reply was polite but firm.

“Would you please spare me just a few minutes? I came from a great distance and it’s not easy for me to pay another visit here in a short time.”

“Then come when you can,” now a chief’s tone (语气), very businesslike.

“Just take a look at this paper. One minute is enough.”

“But I don’t even have one minute, no, not one single minute.”

“Then I must come back again?”

“Right, you must.”

“You are practicing bureaucratism!” I lost control of my temper that had been suppressed (压抑) since I entered the office.

“Good criticism (批评),” the chief smiled and left.

That was “bad” criticism, bad for me, as later I was told that my report was turned down. I was beaten by bureaucratism.

I learned the lesson: bureaucratism hates criticism. It seems that I need to learn more about the battle against that ugly social evil (弊病).

Brazil has become one of the developing world’s great successes at reducing population growth－but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard.

Brazil’s population growth rate has dropped from 2.99% a year between 1951 and 1960 to 1.93% a year between 1981 and 1990, and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. Martine says this figure may have fallen still further since 1990, an achievement that makes it the envy of many other Third World countries.

Martine puts it down to, among other things, soap operas (通俗电视连续剧) and installment (分期付款) plans introduced in the 1970s. both played an important, although indirect, role in lowering, the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world’s biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil’s most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most soaps are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities.

“Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction, they describe middle and upper class values － not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,” says Martine. “They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.”

Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers (消费者). “This led to an enormous change in consumption (消耗、消费) patterns and consumption was incompatible (不相容的) with unlimited reproduction.” Says Martine.

1. According to the passage, Brazil has cut back its population growth ____.

A. by educating its citizens 　　　　　　　　B. by careful family planning

C. by developing TV programmes 　　　　　　　D. by chance

2. According to the passage, many Third World countries ______.

A. haven’t attacked much importance to birth control

B. would soon join Brazil in controlling their birth rate

C. haven’t yet found an effective measure to control their population

D. neglected the role of TV plays in family planning

3. Soap operas have helped in lowering Brazil’s birth rate because ____.

A. they keep people sitting long hours watching TV

B. they have gradually changed people’s way of life

C. people are drawn to their attractive package

D. they popularize birth control measures

4. What is Martine’s conclusion about Brazil’s population growth?

A. The increase in birth rate will increase consumption.

B. The desire for consumption helps to reduce birth rate.

C. Consumption patterns and reproduction patterns are contradictory (互相矛盾的)

D. A country’s production is limited by its population growth.

First－time dog owners may encounter many problems getting to know and train their pets. Sometimes a puppy, or even an older dog, will chew their fingers or bite them. Even in play, this can really hurt. Unfortunately, many pet owners tolerate (容忍) this in a young dog. However, when the dog gets larger, it is not fun to be bitten by it. Training a dog never to place his teeth on human skin or clothing is an important lesson. From now on, if you feel your dog’s teeth while you are playing with him, say “Ouch” in a loud voice and move away from him. He will soon learn that when he bites, you will not play with him any more.

Another bad habit that many people tolerate in their pets is allowing them to bite and hold on to clothing. Don’t let your dog do this to you. When he does something you what him to do, praise him and tell him he’s a good dog. You can also give him a treat at the same time he performs the good behavior. Eventually he will learn which kind of behavior is acceptable and which is not. Remember that reward is more effective than punishment. If you reward your dog when he does what you want to, he will become very well behaved. Also remember that puppies need to chew on something. So give him a sock with a knot tied in it or an old shoe. If he chews the wrong thing, take it away while saying “No” and give him something he can chew. If dogs are trained well, they will truly be your friends for a lifetime.

Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true.

People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge (电荷). It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called “galvanometer”. The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened.

A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them － perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot － then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects (昆虫).

Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room.

Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster’s. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them.

1. Backster was surprised at the results of his studies because _____.

A. he destroyed an insect

B. he destroyed a plant by pulling off its leaves

C. he found that plants could express feelings of shock

D. he found that plants could move and speak after all

2. The plants sent out signals _____.

A. only when Backster Started to destroy plants

B. when Backster destroyed plants or other living things

C. only when he destroyed things such as insects

D. only when Backster placed the galvanometer on the leaves of the plants

3. The scientist called Sauvin _____.

A. did not agree with Backster’s ideas

B. did not get the same sort of results as Backster did

C. got different results from Backster’s

D. found out some of the same things that Backster did

4. Which of the following is true according to the passage?

A. The electrical charge plants carry may shock or frighten us.

B. A tree will signal when it has been cut down.

C. Sauvin could make his plants send out signals some distance away.

D. Plants have feelings because they can receive signals without moving.

The greatest recent changes have ,been in the lives of women ,During the twentieth century there was an unusual shortening of the time of a woman’s life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century would probably have been in her middle twenties ,and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old ,By the time the youngest was fifteen ,the mother would have been id her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years ,during which custom ,chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work, Today women marry younger and have fewer children Usually a woman ‘s youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty－five and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty Even while she has the care of children ,her work is lightened by household appliances （家用电器）and convenience foods.

This important change in women’s way of life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women’ s economic position Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity and most of them took a full－time job However ,when they married ,they usually left work at once and never returned to it ,Today the school－leaving age is sixteen ,many girls stay at school after that age ,and though women tend to marry younger ,more married women stay at work at leas until shortly before their first child is born Very many more after wads ,return to full or part-time work Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage ,with both husband and wife accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfaction of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more e-qually in providing the money and running the home ,according to the abilities and inter-est of each them.

Language learning begins with listening. Children are greatly different in the amount of listening they do before they start speaking, and later starters are often long listeners .Most children will“obey”spoken instructions some time before they can speak, though the word“obey”is hardly accurate as a description of the eager and delighted cooperation usually shown by the child .Before they can speak, many children will also ask questions by gesture and by making questioning noises.

Any attempt to study the development from the noises babies make to their first spo-ken words leads to considerable difficulties. It is agreed that they enjoy making noises ,and that during the first few months one or two noises sort themselves as particularly ex-pressive as delight, pain ,friendliness, and so on But since these can’t be said to show the baby;s intention to communicate ,they can hardly be regarded as early forms of language ,It is agreed, too, that from about three months they play with sounds for enjoyment ,and that by six months theyare able to add new words to their store This self-imitation（摸仿）leads on to deliberate （有意的）imitation of sounds made or words spoken to them by other people. The problem then arises as to the point at which one can say that these imita-tions can be considered as speech.

It is a problem we need to get out teeth into. The meaning of a word depends on what a word depends on what a particular person means by it in a particular situation; and it is clear that what a child means by a word will change as he gains more experience of the world .Thus the use .at seven months .of “mama”as a greeting for his mother cannot be dismissed as a meaning-less sound simply because he also uses it at another times for his father ,his dog ,or any-thing else he likes. Playful and meaningless imitation of what other people say continues after the child has begun to speak for himself ,I doubt ,however whether anything is gained when parents take advantage of this ability in an attempt to teach new sounds .

1．Before children start speaking .

A．they need equal amount of listening

B．they need different amounts of listening

C．they are all eager to cooperate with the adults by obey spoken instructions

D．they can’t understand and obey the adult ‘s oral instructions

2．Children who start speaking late .

A．may have problems with their listening

B．Probably do not hear enough language spoken around them

C．Usually pay close attention to what they hear

D．Often take a long tine in learning to listen properly

3．A baby’s first noises are .

A．an expression of his moods and feelings

B．an early form of language

C．a sign that he means to tell you something

D．An imitation of the speech of adults.

4．The problem of deciding at what point a baby’ imitations can be considered as

speech …

A．is important because words have different meanings for different people

B．is not especially important because the changeover takes place gradually

C．is one that should be properly understood because the meaning of words changes with age.

D．Is one that should be completely ignored（忽略）because children’s use of words is of-ten

meaningless .

5．The speaker implies .

A．parents can never hope to teach their children new sounds.

B．children no longer imitate people after they begin to speak

C．Children who are good at imitating learn new words more quickly

D．even after they have learnt to speak ,children still enjoy imitating

The United States is not the only country affected by the“computer revolution”,All the major countries of the world have computers ,and the developing countries have also realized that computers play a big part in their economic development.

Usually what one sees is a machine that looks like a typewriter ;it is called a computer terminal（终端）But computers are also used in unseen ways For example they determine how much tine there should be between traffic signals to prevent traffic problems and to keep millions of cars moving in an orderly flow When you buy a car ,a factory process （过程）that is controlled by a computer enables you to obtain a car with your own choice of colours and special features （特征）in just a few weeks’ time In medical laboratories ,com-puters have reduced the mistakes in testing ,and they have saved doctors’ countless hours of work Before long ,medical histories of all Americans will be kept in computer “banks”.If a person becomes ill far from his home ,local doctors will be able to get his medical record immediately ,In science the computer has performed in minutes experiments which would have required thousands of hours of work by human hands and minds.

Most experts agree that computers are necessary to solve the problems of increasing population ,city living ,and public affairs Without computers, the jobs of solving these problems would require millions of workers to do tons of paperwork Before any computer can work on any problem, it must be told what to do Someone must program the computer ,step―by―step. At first this was done by having the programmer write out his instructions in the form of numbers which would be“understood”by the machine ,Within a short time, attempts were made to perform a system that would enable humans to communicate programmer could use words that had meanings for him ,and another program in the ma-chine would translate the words into the computer’s number system.

Without special training ,in is impossible to under stand exactly how a computer does int work however ,many people without scientific training use computers in their daily lives .In some American schools for example young children are being taught by comput-ers for part of the school day.

The use of computers in school has worried some Americans There are those who fear is will remove human element（成分）from teacher-student relationships .On the other hand there are educators who consider computer program a valuable means of freeing teachers from the more boring and tiring tasks ,thus enabling them to spend more time with a single student.

In education ,as in business and industry science and medicine ,computers play an important part in almost every type of operation the future will bring major advances in computer technology ,which will aid man in his efforts to improve the world.

Advertising is a highly developed twentieth-century industry. The development of radio, television, cinema, magazines and newspapers has gone hand in hand with the development of advertising. Why is advertising so popular? Is it a waste of money? It has been proved again and again that ?repeated advertising increases product sales. Since it increases production, the price can be reduced. Therefore advertising, instead of making a product more expensive, makes it cheaper.

Advertising is now a scientific business. Once managers would say jokingly, " I know that half of what I spend on advertising is wasted, but I don't know which half." Now, all parts of an advertising programme are properly measured and researched.

What makes a good advertisement? There have been major changes in advertising in the past sixty years.. People read advertisements partly for information and partly for pleasure. Today's advertisements often start with a question, or a puzzle, with the purpose of attracting the reader's attention. Of course, most advertisements contain information. But this is usually contained in a text that is interesting and often funny. Humour is very important. Sometimes advertisements tell a story, or the story may be continued over a number of advertisements. However, there is a danger in this. It is possible that the reader or viewer will remember the advertisement but not the name of the product.

1. The purpose of advertising is ____.

A. to increase product sales

B. to make a product much better

C. to spend more money

D. to reduce the production

2. Which of the following can be used in place of the underlined phrase "hand in hand" ?

Flying Saucers

In 1947 the pilot of a small aeroplane saw nine strange objects in the sky over Washing-ton in the USA. He said that they looked like saucers. Newspapers printed his story un-der the headline "Flying Saucers".

Since then, all over the world, people have reported seeing similar strange objects. No one knows what they are or where they come from. Some people say that they do not exist, but many others say that they have seen them. Usually people on the ground have seen them but not always. Airline pilots also have reported seeing them and so have astro-nauts ── the men who fly in spaceships.

Perhaps some people saw them only in their imagination. Perhaps some people made a mistake. But airline pilots and astro-nauts do not usually make mistakes of this kind. Captain Ed Mitchell, who was the sixth man to walk on the moon, said in 1974 that he believes that some "flying saucers" are real. Many other people now believe that these strange flying objects are visiting the earth from other worlds in space.

"They have come to look at us," they say. The American government tried to find out more about these objects. It listened to a great many people who said they had seen them. But the Government Committee could not decide on what the objects were. It called them UFOs, which is short for "Unidentified Flying Objects".

Some say they have seen people in the fly-ing saucers! In 1964, a driver of a police car in New Mexico saw a UFO landing a mile away. When he reached it, there were two small figures standing near it. They looked like little men. When he reported on his radio, they got inside the object and flew away.

In 1973 two men were out fishing in Mississippi. They say they saw a UFO shaped like an egg. There were three creatures like men but their skins were silver in colour. They had no eyes, and their mouths were just slits (裂缝). Their noses and ears were pointed. They made the fishermen get inside the UFO for a while. Then the creatures photographed them and took them to the place where they had been fishing.

There are many other similar stories. Some are probably untrue but some may be true. No one knows.

Britons Learn to Forgive

LEEDS, England ─ A Leeds University psychology (心理学) professor is teaching a course to help dozens of Britons forgive their enemies.

"The hatred we hold within us is a can-cer," Professor Ken Hart said, adding that holding in anger can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease.

More than 70 people have become mem-bers in Hart's first 20-week workshop in Lon-don ─ a course he says is the first of its kind in the world.

These are people who are sick and tired of living with a memory. They realize their bitterness is a poison they think they can pour out, but they end up drinking it themselves, said Canadian-born Hart.

The students meet in groups of eight to ten for a two-hour workshop with an adviser every fortnight.

The course, ending in July, is expected to get rid of the cancer of hate in these peo-ple. "People have lots of negative attitudes to-wards forgiveness," he said. "People confuse (把……混淆) forgiveness with forgetting. Forgiveness means changing from a negative attitude to a positive one."

Hart and his team have created instruc-tions to provide the training needed.

"The main idea is to give you guidelines on how to look at various kinds of angers and how they affect you, and how to change your attitudes towards the person you are angry with," said Norman Claringbull, a senior expert on the forgiveness project.

Hart said he believes forgiveness is a skill that can be taught, as these people "want to get free of the past".

1. From this passage we know that ______.

A. high blood pressure and heart disease are caused by hatred

B. high blood pressure can only be cured by psychology professors

C. without hatred, people will have less trouble connected with blood and heart

D. people who suffer from blood pressure and heart disease must have many enemies

2. If you are angry with somebody, you should

A. try your best to defeat him or her

B. never meet him or her again

C. persuade him or her to have a talk with you

D. relax yourself by not thinking of him or her any more

3. In Hart's first 20-week workshop, people there can ___.

A. meet their enemies

B. change their minds

C. enjoy the professor's speech

D. learn how to quarrel with others

4. If you are a member in Hart' s workshop, you'll ______.

A. pay much money to Hart

B. go to the workshop every night

C. attend a gathering twice a month

D. pour out everything stored in your mind

5. The author wrote this passage in order to

A. persuade us to go to Hart's workshop

B. tell us the news about Hart's workshop

C. tell us how to run a workshop like Hart's

D. help us to look at various kinds of angers







You are watching a film in which two men are having a fight. They hit one another hard. At the start they only fight with their fists. But soon they begin hitting one another over the heads with chairs. And so it goes on until one of the men crashes (撞击) through a window and falls thirty feet to the ground below. He is dead！Of course he isn't really dead. With any luck he isn't even hurt. Why? Because the men who fall out of high windows or jump from fast moving trains, who crash cars of even catch fire, are professionals. They do this for a living. These men are called stuntmen. That is to say, they perform tricks.There are two sides to their work. They actually do most of the things you see on the screen. For example, they fall from a high building. However, they do not fall on to hard ground but on to empty cardboard boxes covered with a mattress (床垫). Again, when they hit one another with chairs, the chairs are made of soft wood and when they crash through windows, the glass is made of sugar!But although their work depends on trick of this sort, it also requires a high degree of skill and training. Often a stuntman' s success depends on careful timing. For example, when he is "blown up" in a battle scene, he has to jump out of the way of the explosion just at the right moment.

Naturally stuntmen are well paid for their work, but they lead dangerous lives. They often get seriously injured, and sometimes killed. A Norwegian stuntman, for example, skied over the edge of a cliff (悬崖) a thousand feet high. His parachute (降落伞) failed to open, and he was killed. In spite of all the risks, this is no longer a profession for men only. Men no longer dress up as women when actresses have to perform some dangerous action. For nowadays there are stuntgirls tool

1. Stuntmen are those who ______.

A. often dress up as actors

B. prefer to lead dangerous lives

C. often perform seemingly dangerous actions

D. often fight each other for their lives

2. Stuntmen earn their living by ______.

A. playing their dirty tricks

B. selling their special skills

C.jumping out of high windows

D. jumping from fast moving trains

3. When a stuntman falls from a high building, ______.

A.he needs little protection

B. he will be covered with a mattress

C.his life is endangered

D. his safety is generally all right

4. Which of the following is the main factor (因素) of a successful performance?

A. Strength. B. Exactness. C. Speed. D. Carefulness.

5. What can be inferred from the author' s example of the Norwegian stuntman?

A.Sometimes an accident can occur to a stuntman.

B.The percentage of serious accidents is high.

C.Parachutes must be of good quality.

D. The cliff is too high.

activity which was almost unknown to the learned in the early days of the history, while during the fifteenth century the term "reading" undoubtedly meant reading aloud. Only during the nineteenth century did silent reading become popular.

One should be careful, however, of supposing that silent reading came about simply because reading aloud is distraction (分散注意力) to others. Examination of reasons connected with the historical development of silent reading shows that it became the usual mode of reading for most adult reading tasks mainly because the tasks themselves changed in character.

The last century saw a gradual increase in literacy (读写能力) and thus in the number of readers. As readers increased, so the number of listeners dropped, and thus there was some reduction in the need to read aloud. As reading for the benefit of listeners grew less common, so came the popularity of reading as a private activity in such public places as libraries, trains and offices, where reading aloud would disturb other readers in a way.

Towards the end of the century there was still heated argument over whether books should be used for information or treated respectfully, and over whether the reading of material such as newspapers was in some way mentally weakening. Indeed this argument remains with us still in education. However, whatever its advantages, the old shared literacy culture had gone and was replaced by the printed mass media (媒介) on the one hand and by books and magazines for a specialized readership on the other.

By the end of the century students were being advised to have some new ideas of books and to use skills in reading them which were not proper, if not impossible, for the oral reader. The social, cultural, and technological developments in the century had greatly changed what the term "reading" referred to.

1. Why was reading aloud common before the nineteenth century?

A. Because silent reading had not been discovered.

B. Because there were few places for private reading.

C. Because few people could read for themselves.

D. Because people depended on reading for enjoyment.

2. The development of silent reading during the nineteenth century showed .

A. a change in the position of literate people

B. a change in the nature of reading

C. an increase in the number of books

D. an increase in the average age of readers

3. Educationalists are still arguing about _________.

A. the importance of silent reading

B. the amount of information provided by books and newspapers

C. the effects of reading on health

D. the value of different types of reading material

4. What is the writer of this passage attempting to do?

A. To explain how present day reading habits developed.

B. To change people's way to read.

C. To show how reading methods have improved.

D. To encourage the growth of reading.

In some ways, the United States has made some progress. Fires no longer destroy 18,000 buildings as they did in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, or kill half a town of 2,400 people, as they did the same night in Peshtigo, Wisconsin. Other than the Beverly Hill Supper Club fire in Kentucky in 1977, it has been four decades since more than 100 Americans died in a fire.

But even with such successes, the United States still has one of the worst fire death rates in the world. Safety experts say the problem is neither money nor technology, but the indifference(无所谓) of a country that just will not take fires seriously enough.

American fire departments are some of the world's fastest and best-equipped. They have to be. The United States has twice Japan's population, and 40 times as many fires. It spends far less on preventing fires than on fighting them. And American fire -safety lessons are aimed almost entirely at children, who die in large numbers in fires but who, against popular beliefs, start very few of them.

Experts say the error is an opinion that fires are not really anyone's fault. That is not so in other countries, where both public education and the law treat fires as either a personal failing or a crime(罪行). Japan has many wood houses; of the 48 fires in world history that burned more than 10,000 buildings, Japan has had 27. Punishment for causing a big fire can be as severe as life imprisonment.

In the United States, most education dollars are spent in elementary schools. But, the lessons are aimed at too limited a number of people; just 9 percent of all fire deaths are caused by children playing with matches.

The United States continues to depend more on technology than laws or social pressure. There are smoke detectors in 85 percent of all homes. Some local building laws now require home sprinklers (喷水装置). New heaters and irons shut themselves off if they are tipped.

1. The reason why so many Americans die in fires is that _____.

A. they took no interest in new technology

B. they did not pay great attention to preventing fires

C. they showed indifference to fighting fires

D. they did not spend enough money on fire equipment

2. It can be inferred from the passage that______.

A. fire safety lessons should not be aimed only at American children

B. American children have not received enough education of fire safety lessons

C. Japan is better equipped with fire equipment than the United States

D. America's large population leads to more fires

3. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?

A. There has been no great fire in the USA in recent 40 years that leads to high death rate.

B. There have been several great fires in the USA in recent 40 years that lead to high death rate.

C. There has been only one great fire in the USA in recent 40 years that led to high death rate.

D. The fire in Kentucky in 1977 made only a few people killed.

Nuclear power's(核能的) danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be described in one word; radiation(辐射).

Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected (探测) by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.

At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells (细胞) in important organs (器官). But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.

This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated(放射治疗) and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.

Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth.

1. According to the passage, the danger of nuclear power lies in __________.

A. nuclear mystery B. radiation detection

C. radiation level D. nuclear radiation

2. Radiation can lead to serious results even at the lowest level ________.

A. when it kills few cells

B. if it damages few cells

C. though the damaged cells can repair themselves

D. unless the damaged cells can reproduce themselves

3. Radiation can hurt us in the way that it can _____.

A. kill large numbers of cells in main organs so as to cause death immediately

B. damage cells which may grow into cancer years later

C. affect the healthy growth of our younger generation

D. lead to all of the above results

4. Which of the following can be best inferred from the passage?

A. The importance of protection from radiation cannot be overemphasized (过分强调).

B. The mystery about radiation remains unsolved.

C. Cancer is mainly caused by radiation.

Today is the date of that afternoon in April a year ago when I first saw the strange and attractive doll（玩具娃娃）in the window of Abe Sheftel's toy shop on Third Avenue near Fifteenth Street, just around the corner from my office, where the plate on the door reads. Dr Samuel Amory. I remember just how it was that day: the first sign of spring floated across the East River, mixing with the soft - coal smoke from the factories and the street smells of the poor neighbourhood. As I turned the corner on my way to work and came to Sheftel's, I was made once more known of the poor collection of toys in the dusty window, and I remembered the coming birthday of a small niece of mine in Cleveland, to whom I was in the habit of sending small gifts. Therefore, I stopped and examined the window to see if there might be anything suitable, and looked at the collection of unattractive objects--a red toy fire engine, some lead soldiers, cheap baseballs, bottles of ink, pens, yellowed envelopes, and advertisements for soft - drinks. And thus it was that my eyes finally came to rest upon the doll stored away in one corner, a doll with the strangest, most charming expression on her face. I could not wholly make her out, due to the shadows and the film of dust through which I was looking, but I was sure that a deep impression had been made upon me as though I had run into a person, as one does sometimes with a stranger, with whose personality one is deeply impressed.

1. What made an impression on the author?

A. The doll's unusual face.

B. The collection of toys.

C. A stranger he met at the store.

Technology is the application (应用)of knowledge to production. Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available (有用的)to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animalbreeding techniques, and has extended our life span via()medical technology.

Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends upon research and development, and the latest statistics (统计) show that the united States is continuing to pump billions of dollars annually(每年) into such efforts. So while we are running out of some scarce resources (少的资源) we may well find technological substitutes (代用品) for many of them through our research programs.

Therefore, in the final analysis the three major factors of production (land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology. When we need new skills on techniques in medicine, people will start developing new technology to meet those needs. As equipment proves to be slow or inefficient, new machines will be invented. Technology responds to our needs in helping us maintain our standard of living.

The volcano is one of the most surprising frightening forces of nature. Maybe you have seen pictures of these“fireworks”of nature. Sometimes when a volcano erupts, a very large wall of melted rock moves down the side of a mountain. It looks like a “river of tire.”Sometimes volcanoes explode, throwing the melted rock and ashes(灰)high into the air. But where does this melted rock come from?

The earth is made up of many layers(层). The top layer that we see is called the crust. Under the crust are many layers of hard rock. But far, far beneath the crust whose rock is so hot, that it is soft. In some places it even melts. The melted rock is called magma. Sometimes the magma breaks out to the surface through cracks(爆裂声)in the crust. These cracks are volcanoes.

Most people think of mountains when they think of volcanoes. But not every mountain is a volcano. A volcano is simply the opening in the earth from which the magma escapes. The hot magma, or lava as it is called, cols and builds up on the surface of the earth. Over thousands of years, this pile of cooled lava can grow to be very, very big. For example, the highest mountain in Africa, Kilimanjaro, is a volcano. It towers more than 16,000 feet above the ground around it.

1.The underlined word“erupts”means .

A. moves down B. breaks away

C. builds up D. suddenly throws out lava

When I asked my daughter which item she would keep; the phone, the car, the cooker, the computer, the TV, or her boyfriend, she said“the phone”. Personally, I could do without the phone entirely, which makes me unusual. Because the telephone is changing our lives more than any other piece of technology.

Point 1 The telephone creates the need to communicate, in the same way that more roads create more traffic. My daughter comes home from school at 4:00 pm and then spends an hour on the phone talking to the very people she has been at school with all day. If the phone did not exist, would she have anything to talk about?

Point 2 The mobile phone means that we are never alone. “The mobile saved my life,”says Crystal Johnstone. She had an accident in her Volvo on the A45 between Otley and Skipton. Trapped inside, she managed to make the call that brought the ambulance(救护车) to her rescue.

Point 3 The mobile removes our secret. It allows marketing manager of Haba Deutsch, Carl Nicolaisen, to ring his sales staff all round the world at and time of day to ask where they are , where they are going, and how their last meeting went.

Point 4 The telephone separates us. Antonella Bramante in Rome says, “We worked in separate offices but I could see him through the window. It was easy to get his number. We were so near——but we didn’t meet for the first two weeks!”

Point 5 The telephone allows us to reach out beyond our own lives. Today we can talk to several complete strangers simultaneously ( 同时地) on chat lines (at least my daughter does. I wouldn’t know what to talk about). We can talk across the world. We can even talk to astronauts (if you know any) while they’re space-walking. And, with the phone line hooked up to the computer, we can access(存取) the Internet, the biggest library on Earth.

1.How do you understand‘Point 1 —The telephone creates the need to communicate,6…’？

A. People don’t communicate without telephone.

B. People communicate because of the creating of the telephone.

C. People communicate more since telephone has been created.

D. People communicate more because of more traffic.

2.Which of the following best shows people’s attitude towards mobile phones?

A. Mobile phones help people deal with the emergency.

B. Mobile phones bring convenience as well little secret to people.

C. Mobile phones are so important and should be encouraged.

D. Mobile phones are part of people’s life.

“It hurts me more than you”, and “This is for your own good”—these are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin, clean my room, stay home and do homework.

That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation.

Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we’ve made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students—“so passive”—and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Klompus, contributes to children’ s passivity. “We’ re talking about a generation of kids who’ ve never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying ‘go and look it up’, you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid.”

Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It’ s time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work. It’ s time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it’ s for their own good. It’s s time to start telling them no again.

1.Children are becoming more inactive in study because .

A. they watch TV too often B. they have done too much homework

C. they have to fulfil too many duties D. teachers are too strict with them

2.We learn from the passage that the author’s mother used to lay emphasis on .

A. learning Latin B. discipline

C. natural development D. education at school

A. when children are allowed to do what they wish to

B. when everything can be taught at school

C. when every child can be educated

D. when children are permitted to receive education

A. parents should leave their children alone

B. kids should have more activities at school

C. it’s time to be more strict with our kids

D. parents should always set a good example to their kids
